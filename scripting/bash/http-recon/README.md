# HTTP Recon tool

Author: setzexe (cyberseverane)

**What problem does this tool solve?**

- Quickly gather basic HTTP information about a target (IP or weblink) to understand how a web server responds and what it exposes. Standard recon.

**Version 1.0**

- Accept's a single target (domain or IP)
- Validate Input
- Checks if target is reachable
- Make an HTTP request
- Display HTTP headers
- Exit

Future versions will handle port scanning, HTTPS cases, brute force, HTML parsing, and fingerprints beyond headers. For now, this is just an introduction to recon and scripting.

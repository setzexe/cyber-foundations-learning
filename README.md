# cyber-foundations-learning

This repository focuses on my self-directed learning in Cybersecurity.
This means a heavy focus on the fundamentals of Cybersecity, such as Linux, Networking, Red Teaming and Blue Teaming.
It is essential to understand the foundations of Cyber before actually barging in with no understanding.
At the end of the day, you need to think like a hacker to outsmart a hacker. 

Understand the systems around you.
Understand how these systems work together. It is all one big, beautiful network.

Rather than working purely with tools or theory, this repo emphasizes both. This focuses on:
- How systems work
- Why certain security implementations exist for different systems
- How both red team and blue team thinks
- How all these connect into the world of cyber as a whole


Each folder represens a different core pillar of cybersecurity. These folders conatin notes, small scripts, and beyond that were created during hands-on learning.

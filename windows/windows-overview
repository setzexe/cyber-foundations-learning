# Windows Overview

Windows is built on the NT kernal, which seperates system operations into user mode and kernal mode for security. Most corporate endpoints run Windows, making it a primary attack surface.

Blue teaming monitoring and logging depends heavily on Windows internals.

## Windows Editions

Windows has multiple editions.
- Home: Consumer use. Most personal computers use this.
- Pro: Allows BitLocker encryption + advanced management
- Enterprise: Large corporations with centralized security controls
- Server: Hosts services, domain control, infrastructure

Different editions = Different attack surfaces. **Enterprise and Server** are high-value targets.

## Kernal Mode

The kernal mode allows full system access, while the user mode applies restricted access to important components.

In a cybersecurity context, a malware that manages to escalate permissions from user --> kernal means full system compromise. It can do whatever it wants to the system.

## GUI-Centric Design

A primary reason to why Windows appeals to it's large audience is the fact that it relies heavily on a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**. The desktop is graphical, the start menu is graphical, the basic features are understandable. 

This can also be seen as a negative from a defense standpoint. Users are conditioned to trust prompts and graphics. If they click a misleading one, that can do terrible damage. Many attacks happen this way, with malware pretending to be legitimate services.
